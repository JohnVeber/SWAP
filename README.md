# SWAP
This is a simple program originally intended to be an implementation of standard swap() function in C language for exchanging a pair of variables values​​.

The initial task (beta branch) was to try write this function without pointers ).
Status: *Released at v.0.0.1

The next task (v.1 branch) was to create a worked version of the program.
In addition an interactive input should be supported.
One more structure detail should be sepatation one .c file to a several, adding neccesary headers and filling the project by nessesary CMake files.
Status: *Released at v.1.1.0

The next task (v.2 branch) was to change the layout of project files (src, test folders need to be added). A pair of simple unit-tests need to be added.
Status: *Released with one test only at v.2.0.2
Unfinished part of the task: One more test need to be added.

The current tasks (v.3 branch) are:
-implement passing arguments to a function via command line options (DONE)
-add one more test
-implement program termination if an unexpected number of arguments is entered (DONE)
Status: *(In progress at v.3 branch).
